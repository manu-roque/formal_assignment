I went with React and Typescript for this project.

There are some sections missing such as the tab filtering and the / for commands part as well as showing any results from the searches done in the input. Some of the animations were a bit tricky to pull off especially going from the search bar into a searchbar modal. I opted to do most of the code on my own without relying on external libraries.

The main page works fine with the scroll and sections added with the cards. The components also work dynamically as if we were gathering the data from a database, this means that we can have as many cards or tabs or sections on the modal as there are results. Some parts such as the question section in the modal and the cards at the bottom were hardcoded but they can be easily changed by doing some mock data in an array of objects and rendering it with the map function

A lot of time of development was spent analyzing the video and trying to find the correct sizing for everything, one thing to note is that the project is NOT responsive at all as it would take an extensive amount of time to do it without all the specs from figma.

I would love to discuss more what I could have done different as well as explain how I would approach the rest of the project.

Again thank you for giving me this opportunity and I wish you a great day.
